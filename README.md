# KAGGLE SURVEY 2020 ANALYSIS
This repo contains an analysis of the 2020 Kaggle Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Survey. The data used is located in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data 


### DATA ENGINEERING
The [Data Cleaning notebook](https://github.com/rfisla/KAGGLE_SURVEY_2020_ANALYSIS/blob/main/DATA_CLEANING.ipynb) shows the changes and transformations made as the previous step of analizing the Kaggle Survey. The main points of these notebook are:

- The first step was joining the 2 first rows into a unique header (joining the number of the question with the question)

- The main goal was to join the columns that are part of the same question, in order to have all the answers in the same column and make the following analysis easier.
This was the function that solved this problem:

```python
def grouping ():
    # 1. Filtering the columns IÂ´m going to group by selecting the question
    #2. Joining the columns of the same question into one new column
    #3. Dropping the columns used
    question = input('Enter the number of the question')
    name = input("Enter the name of the column: ")
    survey[name] = survey.filter(regex=question, axis=1).apply(' '.join, axis=1)
    survey.drop(survey.filter(regex=question, axis=1), 1 , inplace= True)
    return f'{question} grouped'
```
- The final step was enumerating the columns by adding another index, in order to to identify and work better with them during the analysis.


### DATA ANALYSIS THROUGH GRAHPS [Link](https://github.com/rfisla/KAGGLE_SURVEY_2020_ANALYSIS/blob/main/KAGGLE_SURVEY_ANALYSIS.ipynb)

I needed a way to count and rank the  grouped columns, wwhich have several items in the same row. This is the function created for this goal:

```python
def ranking_by_column(data, number_of_column, list_of_options):
    list = []
    for i in data.iloc[:,number_of_column]:
        list.append(i)
    string = ' '. join(list)
    count = []
    for i in list_of_options:
        count.append(string.count(i))
    ranking = pd.DataFrame(data= count, index= list_of_options, columns=['Total']).sort_values(by='Total',ascending=False)
    #ranking['%'] = ranking['Total'].apply(lambda x: x/20036*100)
    return ranking
  ```

I graphically represented those questions that I was more interested on. In some of the questions I wanted to know if there was some differences between the answers of the general survey and the answers of people of my range of age, so in those questions I represent two graphs, one for each profile, to compare the results.

**The general survey has been done by 20.036 persons, and the number of people who matched with my profile is 2.246**

These are the main graphs obtained from the notebook:
